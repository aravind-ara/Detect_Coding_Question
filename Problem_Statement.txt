Problem Statement for Python Application Developer

Below is your problem statement to solve which is a part of the technical round interview for the Python Application Developer role.

Problem statement:

Develop an algorithm using python-3 that will take two inputs,

Input 1: A sentence in string format
Input 2: A text file (*.txt) with a list of sentences

compares input 1 with all sentences in Input 2 and returns the most synonymically suitable sentence from Input 2.

Add necessary boundary/fail-safe conditions and validation to make the same robust, package as an application with GUI. Revert this mail with a zip file containing the software package, source code, and other relevant files.


Sample Output:
Input 1: HC:Unsafe condition: Access not provided in the excavation for ingress/egress
Input 2: HC:Unsafe condition: Excavation access not provided
Output: HC:Unsafe condition: No access for ingress/egress



Input 1: -	 
Input 2: HC:Unsafe environment: No access for is provided in the excavation
Output: -

Input 1:
Input 2: HC:Unsafe condition: Entry and exit is not provided
Output: 

Input 1: -	 
Input 2: HC:Unsafe condition: No access for ingress/egress is provided in the excavation	
Output: -

Input 1: -	 
Input 2: HC:Unsafe condition:No access for ingress/egress		
Output: -
